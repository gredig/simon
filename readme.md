# Colors 

1. Create 4 squares of equal size that take up half the width of the screen in total and give them colors:

	+---------------+--------------+
	|               |              |
	|               |              |
	|     red       |    yellow    |
	|               |              |
	|               |              |
	+---------------+--------------+
	|               |              |
	|               |              |
	|     blue      |    green     |
	|               |              |
	|               |              |
	+---------------+--------------+

2. Make it so clicking on a square will briefly lighten the color (and then return to the original)

3. Add a button to the page that will briefly lighten the color of the last box you clicked

4. Modify your code such that you can click a number of boxes in a row and then clicking the button will play the sequence with a brief pause between flashes

5. Add a button that will reset the sequence (preferably without reloading the page)

6. Create a button that will generate a random 5 square sequence

7. Modify your code so that your own sequence is tested against the random sequence.
